# A Bayesian Markov Regime-Switching Model of Stock Return Volatility: Evidence from the Moroccan All Shares Index

This repository includes the code used in one of the master's projects "A Bayesian Markov Regime-Switching Model of Stock Return Volatility: Evidence from the Moroccan All Shares Index" by Khalil Belghouat.

In this project, a Bayesian Markov regime-switching approach is followed in order to describe and predict the volatility of the Moroccan All Shares Index returns.
