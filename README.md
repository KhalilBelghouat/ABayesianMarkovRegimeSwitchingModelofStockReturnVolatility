# A Bayesian Markov Regime-Switching Model of Stock Return Volatility: Evidence from the Moroccan All Shares Index

This repository includes the code used in one of the master's projects "A Bayesian Markov Regime-Switching Model of Stock Return Volatility: Evidence from the Moroccan All Shares Index" by Khalil Belghouat.

In this project, a Bayesian Markov regime-switching approach is followed in order to describe and predict the volatility of the Moroccan All Shares Index returns.

## Prerequisites

The ```R``` programming language, version 4.0.3, and its statistical and machine learning libraries were used to build all applied models. The ```R``` script _packages.R_ in the _packages_ folder installs and loads all necessary ```R``` packages. 

All operations, from data preprocessing to model estimation, were carried out on the Google Colaboratory platform.
